In vague order of importance.

High Prio
-- Title doesn't allow apostrophes? Or parenthesis?
-- Formal object for lines?
    Search for everything that calls setcell/getcell/grid reference, and see if it makes it better or worse.

Browse
-- Dynamic list generation
-- "Jump to top" button
-- Sorting
-- Batched list generation
-- Infinite scrolling?
-- Add more sorting types.
    Date (default)
    Solve count?
    Popularity?
    By mechanic?
-- Consider preloading puzzles in the python layer.

Editor
-- Look into "cancel" solving? Might be hard, since I'm on main thread.
    Hard, look into old worker code
-- Crayons could be colored in, maybe.
-- At the full drag limit, start points can shift by 0.5 cells
-- Decide if shape chooser should pop over the right buttons or not.
-- (!)Import isn't clearing the negation state (and probably other 'load' functions, too)
    Neither is 'draw on the grid again'. I think redraw() has a bug.
-- Just lower the max puzzle size. 8x8 max? 10 just seems... humongous.
-- (!)Once a solution is published, it appears to be clearing lines from the published solution (so arrows have odd behavior)

Tracing
-- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
    The game is awful at this too.
-- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is
    If it makes it easier, rm cursor when finishing

Server
-- Start versioning JS? That way caching works and doesn't shoot me in the foot.
-- Signin?
-- Telemetry dashboard
    Probably password protect this? Use Flask-BasicAuth w/ RDS password (for simplicity)
    Consider changing UUIDType to just be a string -- it's pain to read.

Low Prio
-- Add all puzzles in the game to the system. Maybe a separate category / identifier?
    Add tests & speedrunner solver
-- Have feedback link to session ID?
-- Add 'happy' to feedback?
-- Favicon still needs improving
    RM the dot, it's invisible
    Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
-- Animation for start-grow isn't playing for primary line
-- Improvements to publish.py
    Javascript versioning/hashing would be nice
-- ES6 modernization
    JS supports 'format strings', via `foo ${bar}`
    Replace XMLHttpRequest with Fetch
-- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
-- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
    I think this is legacy from the old index.html, solve is no longer directly possible
-- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
    Maybe have a class="centered"
-- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
    Checkboxes are terrible. Maybe write my own?
-- random generation for challenges
    copy game RNG should be easy (now that I do it myself)
    use trace callback func
    maze can be 'click to reveal' like memory card game
    should play the music if I can
-- Getting a timeout on BD5CD4CF with (RRRR UUUU) -- good place to look at perf
-- Nightly builds? https://semaphoreci.com/jbzdarkid/jbzdarkid-github-io/settings
