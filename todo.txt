- Work on speedrunning solver / improving "unique puzzles"
  Can't do this just with a cache key -- but I can recompute the key for all the regions after the fact.
  Or I could make a key for the puzzle as a whole? Regardless, not as easy as just hacking the cache key.
- Perf TODOS:
  * Early validate for triangles... specifically 1 & 2 (if they have 2/3 sides covered)
  * Find a way to make color counts cheaper, *especially* when there are no elements that care.

-- Sorting
    Date (default, currently implemented)
    Solve count?
    Popularity? (-> rating system)
    By mechanic?

Editor
-- Pillar + resize is still horrendously broken.
-- Look into "cancel" solving? Just set max solutions to 0 (and use + to indicate uncertainty)
   Seems like this doesn't actually abort quickly, for some reason.
-- Add support for different rulesets. Also add tests for different rulesets (probably just add'l counts for each set).
-- Disable 'delete' button when there are no more puzzles to delete?
-- Disable 'new' button (or make it no-op) when on an empty puzzle?

Tracing
-- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
    The game is awful at this too.
-- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is
    If it makes it easier, rm cursor when finishing

Server
-- Sign-in?

Tutorial
-- Make a list of all the differences from the game (each needs a tutorial or a setting)
    Have a 'left/right arrows' with a bunch of puzzle images (or maybe animated static objects)
    [image]\n[explanation]\n[left arrow] step # [right arrow]
-- Need to explain complex mechanics
    Double negation
    Polys outside the grid
    Poly overlapping
    Precise polyominos
    Two-stage negation
-- Sadly, need to explain normal mechanics
    The best option here is to cherry-pick puzzles from the base game.
    That way, people can recognize mechanics. That said, since I'll provide text, there's no reason to go that slowly.
-- Should also have an explanation for the different 'styles' (which is probably how I'll implement settings)

Low Prio / Misc
-- Cross-browser compatibility
    In order: Firefox, Safari, iOS Safari, Android Chrome
-- "Edit this puzzle"?
-- Add all puzzles in the game to the system. Maybe a separate category / identifier?
    Add tests & speedrunner solver
-- Favicon still needs improving
    RM the dot, it's invisible
    Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
-- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
    >general support for random puzzles
-- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
    Checkboxes are terrible. Maybe write my own?
-- random generation for challenges
    copy game RNG should be easy (now that I do it myself)
    use trace callback func
    maze can be 'click to reveal' like memory card game
    should play the music if I can
-- Mobile UI is terrible / non-functional.
-- Update deps (?)
-- Startpoint collision
