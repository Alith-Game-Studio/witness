In vague order of importance.

High Prio
-- Crazyhorse-style "edge-trapping" doesn't work with gap-2
-- Formal object for lines?
-- Nightly builds? https://semaphoreci.com/jbzdarkid/jbzdarkid-github-io/settings
-- Recompute solve limits for pillars, symmetry, and symmetrical pillars

Tracing
-- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
-- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is
    If it makes it easier, rm cursor when finishing
-- Just compute sym every frame and update it (immediately after data.pos). It's expensive to recompute this always.
    Ditto for symmetricalDir

Background validation
-- Replace XMLHttpRequest with Fetch?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag) [WIP]
   Still need to fix chrome on the server (try phantomjs again?)
-- Background validation should *stop* returning internal errors. Who needs to see them?

Editor
-- Editor dragging has deadzone -- there should be a magic pixel (or they should be much closer.)
-- Look into "cancel" solving? Might be hard, since I'm on main thread.
    Hard, look into old worker code
-- 1-wide puzzles are about 10px too small, which makes the right-drag incorrect.
-- Swapping symmetry modes can wind up with not having valid pairings?
-- Better UI for "draggable edge"
-- Set width to 1, change default -> P+H symmetry, throws.
-- Shape chooser is not centered
-- Crayons could be colored in, maybe.

Server
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Start versioning JS? That way caching works and doesn't shoot me in the foot.
-- Signin?
-- Telemetry dashboard
    Probably password protect this? Use Flask-BasicAuth w/ RDS password (for simplicity)
-- Save puzzle title separately for meta:title?
-- Consider changing UUIDType to just be a string -- it's pain to read.

Low Prio
-- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
-- Favicon still needs improving
    RM the dot, it's invisible
    Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
-- Consider moving (0, 0) to something large like (1000, 1000) to improve wraparound perf
-- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
-- JS supports 'format strings', via `foo ${bar}`
    Too modern? Should check avail on my target platforms, specifically mobile
-- What uses getRotations? Why do we need rot=null?
-- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
    Maybe have a class="centered"
-- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
    Checkboxes are terrible. Maybe write my own?
