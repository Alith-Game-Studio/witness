In vague order of importance.

- Start-grow animation
- What is .line in animations doing?
- Fix generation colors
- console.group() whenever I have recursion. Please.
- Simple Symmetry (horiz/verti)
!- Stable release
- Favicon still needs improving
- Rich line data -> Done
-- End into the grid?
-- Empty segments (not just gaps)
-- Colored symmetry lines (0/1/2)
-- Colored Dots
-- Mid-segment endpoints
- When a region fails, but has negation symbols in it, they should still negate things -- even if those negations did not result in a successful puzzle. Note that this includes recursion....
- Consider moving (0, 0) to something large like (1000, 1000) to improve wraparound perf
- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
- Server
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
    Create IAM for S3 access
    Somehow wire S3 access token into python
    Use S3 API  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html

    Kick off a background task? -> Tie to puzzle creation
    Use legacy/send_email.py to generate images (with selenium/phantomjs)
-- Telemetry dashboard
    Probably password protect this? Use Flask-BasicAuth w/ RDS password (for simplicity)

- Invisible Dots
!- Feature complete!

!- Small things / Bugs
- What uses getRotations? Why do we need rot=null?
- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Add missing daily styles
- Shape chooser is not centered
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
