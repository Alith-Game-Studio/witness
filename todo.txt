In vague order of importance.

- Rich line data -> Done
-- Formal object, maybe?
- Better UI for "draggable edge" (editor)
- Nightly builds again? https://semaphoreci.com/jbzdarkid/jbzdarkid-github-io/settings

- Server
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
    Create IAM for S3 access
    Somehow wire S3 access token into python
    Use S3 API  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html

    Kick off a background task? -> Tie to puzzle creation
    Use legacy/send_email.py to generate images (with selenium/phantomjs)
    This is also where I should validate the solution (client-side provided, always) to prevent cheesing.
-- Telemetry dashboard
    Probably password protect this? Use Flask-BasicAuth w/ RDS password (for simplicity)

- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
- Favicon still needs improving
-- RM the dot, it's invisible
-- Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
- Consider moving (0, 0) to something large like (1000, 1000) to improve wraparound perf
- Editor dragging has deadzone -- there should be a magic pixel (or they should be much closer.)
- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
- Any time I pass (x, y) as parameters, I should probably pass {'x':x, 'y':y}
-- Risky, means pass-by-reference
- JS supports 'format strings', via `foo ${bar}`
-- Too modern? Should check avail on my target platforms, specifically mobile
- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
- Replace XMLHttpRequest with Fetch?
- mid-segment starts are still graphically buggy
- Test for internal endpoint
-- (editor) Internal endpoint can still overlap if object is placed second, _enforceEndpoints?
- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is
-- If it makes it easier, rm cursor when finishing
- Crazyhorse-style "edge-trapping" doesn't work with gap-2
- Look into "cancel" solving? Might be hard, since I'm on main thread.
- (editor) Ensure that start/endpoints can't be placed on gap-2 (or when all adjent edges are gap-2)
- Save puzzle title separately for meta:title?
- 1-wide puzzles are about 10px too small, which makes the right-drag incorrect.
- gap-2 sometimes looks like an endpoint. Consider making them flat.
- Add tests for mid-segment start/end + polyominos (or regions in general)
- Set width to 1, change default -> P+H symmetry, throws.

!- Small things / Bugs
- What uses getRotations? Why do we need rot=null?
- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Shape chooser is not centered
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
-- Checkboxes are terrible. Maybe write my own?
- Crayons could be colored in, maybe.
